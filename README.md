# Face-Recognition-using-neural-network

#Algorithm.

#1.first the face is detected from the given image.

#2.Then we apply Gabor-filter which detect the edges like eyes,nose and lips etc.

#3.Now we divide the image into 9 parts and apply LSP method on each part 
and combine the features obtained from each part.

#4.The obtained features were fed into the Neural Network for the training.

#5.Repeat the above step for all images.

#Start with newfacecrop1 file.

#we had used the standard orl face data.

#the last file NNT.m does the training and testing of images and describes the accuracy upto which the images matched correctly.
